Dry Lining
</h3>

<p class="paragraph">Dry lining is a system for cladding the internal faces of buildings, such as walls and ceilings. Plasterboard is attached to the internal faces, creating a smooth surface that finishes such as paint can be applied to directly, a 'wet' plaster finish is not required.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Plasterboards has a core of plaster which provides good acoustic and fire insulation. Moisture resistant plasterboards are treated with wax and can be useful when dry lining bathrooms for example.</p>

Loft Converted
</h3>

<p class="paragraph">If your home has sufficient loft space, then a conversion is the most cost-effective way to add an extra room or rooms to your home, and to increase your property value at the same time.</p>

<p class="paragraph">There are several different kinds of loft conversion to consider.
Roof extensions are the most straightforward, but depend on having a suitable roof.
A dormer loft conversion is a loft extension to your roof, but doesn't normally take up the whole of the roof space. It also has the advantage of adding plenty of natural light.
Mansard extensions doesn't add to the roof space, but rebuilds the whole side of the roof.
Whichever you choose, the good news is that, with the exception of Mansard loft conversions, planning permission is almost never required (although we will always advise on this).</p>

            Underfloor Heating
        </h2>
</div>
<p class="paragraph">Underfloor heating can be installed on new-build projects, or retrofitted into existing spaces. It can be installed as the primary heating system or used to provide additional, localised heating in specific spaces such as bathrooms. It may be used in combination with renewable heat sources, thermal mass and night-time purging.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The installation of underfloor heating in an existing property does not need planning permission. If you are building an extension or a conservatory, then planning permission will be needed, however, the heating system would be part of the overall plans for this construction and would not require separate planning permission.</p>

<p class="paragraph">--Underfloor heating can be considered more healthy, separating heating from ventilation, and so reducing draughts and problems associated with dust, pollen and other pollutants.
--It can be more durable, quieter and easier to maintain.
--It creates a more comfortable, even temperature distribution.
--It can be space saving and unobtrusive.
--It can be quieter than conventional radiators or HVAC systems.</p>
