        External Rendering

<p class="paragraph">An external render is, in its most basic form, a coating applied to the walls of a building, to provide a protective coating which would prevent rain penetration. It also acts as a decorative finish to enhance the appearance of a building.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Damp can also be caused by rainwater leaking in through cracks in the brickwork. The render will form a protective waterproof barrier on the external walls, repelling water and preventing water ingress in future.</p>
