        External Rendering

<p class="paragraph">An external render is, in its most basic form, a coating applied to the walls of a building, to provide a protective coating which would prevent rain penetration. It also acts as a decorative finish to enhance the appearance of a building.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Damp can also be caused by rainwater leaking in through cracks in the brickwork. The render will form a protective waterproof barrier on the external walls, repelling water and preventing water ingress in future.</p>

<p class="paragraph">A garage conversion is a great way to make the most of your existing space, but it does require careful thought and planning to make sure you maximise the opportunity and the value that it could add to your home.</p>

<p class="paragraph">If you have got a garage attached to your property that you barely use and are in desperate need of extra living space, then it is well worth considering a garage conversion. Not only does a garage conversion allow you to make much better use of existing square footage without the need to extend, but the project also offers little disruption until it is time to knock through.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Don’t move out, move outwards. If you have outgrown your home then extend. Today it’s far easier than ever before to build the stylish kitchen extension, fully equipped home gym, orangery relaxation room or open-plan entertaining space for family meals and parties with friends without limits. Combine this with a refurbishment of the rest of your home and you could live somewhere completely new without having to move..</p>
