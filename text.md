Underfloor heating specialists, ////////////////////

Underfloor heating can be installed on new-build projects, or retrofitted into existing spaces. It can be installed as the primary heating system or used to provide additional, localised heating in specific spaces such as bathrooms. It may be used in combination with renewable heat sources, thermal mass and night-time purging.

The installation of underfloor heating in an existing property does not need planning permission. If you are building an extension or a conservatory, then planning permission will be needed, however, the heating system would be part of the overall plans for this construction and would not require separate planning permission.

--Underfloor heating can be considered more healthy, separating heating from ventilation, and so reducing draughts and problems associated with dust, pollen and other pollutants.
--It can be more durable, quieter and easier to maintain.
--It creates a more comfortable, even temperature distribution.
--It can be space saving and unobtrusive.
--It can be quieter than conventional radiators or HVAC systems.

Projection plaster,////////////////////

Specialist Finishers have used Projection Plaster or Spray Plaster as it is often referred to in Europe, for many years. This method is now being recognised on commercial projects in the UK because of its speed and efficiency.

Projection Plaster can reduce the time taken to apply and finish the plaster on your project to as little as a third of that required by the traditional 2 coat system which means using less personnel on site for the same volume of works completed. It’s cleaner, which means an easier to manage working environment and making it more Health and Safety friendly.

Projection Plaster has a drying time of 3-4 hours and provides a tough and durable smooth white surface ready to receive a normal decorative finish. Being machine applied, Knauf MP75 offers excellent productivity and is up to 3 times faster than traditional plastering methods. We are a recommended contractor for Knauf Drywall.

Dry lining, //////////////////////////

Dry lining is a system for cladding the internal faces of buildings, such as walls and ceilings. Plasterboard is attached to the internal faces, creating a smooth surface that finishes such as paint can be applied to directly, a 'wet' plaster finish is not required. 

Plasterboards has a core of plaster which provides good acoustic and fire insulation. Moisture resistant plasterboards are treated with wax and can be useful when dry lining bathrooms for example.

New build, ////////////////////

If you're looking for a complete new property, sourcing the right new build builder is one of the first steps to success.

New builds in London are growing in popularity, for two main reasons. One is that building your own home to your exact specifications is always going to be an attractive option for many of us. As long as you pick the right location and plot, it can also be cheaper than buying an existing house.

The other reason is that as an investment, building your own property is hard to beat. Whatever the general economic conditions, there is now and will be for many years to come a shortage of property in London.

There are also other important advantages if you build your own property. For example, you can ensure that the house is highly energy-efficient and built using environmentally-friendly materials and methods.

Klimstar can advise on all areas of building your own home, from initial ideas and planning regulations through to construction. We provide all kinds of new builds, including both traditional and timber frame builds.

We can also fit out your new house so it's ready to live in or to rent or sell, as we use a full range of craftspeople and other professionals, from tilers and carpenters through to plumbers and electricians - for details, see our home refurbishment page

External rendering, ////////////////////

An external render is, in its most basic form, a coating applied to the walls of a building, to provide a protective coating which would prevent rain penetration. It also acts as a decorative finish to enhance the appearance of a building.

Damp can also be caused by rainwater leaking in through cracks in the brickwork. The render will form a protective waterproof barrier on the external walls, repelling water and preventing water ingress in future

Loft converted,////////////////////

If your home has sufficient loft space, then a conversion is the most cost-effective way to add an extra room or rooms to your home, and to increase your property value at the same time.

There are several different kinds of loft conversion to consider.

Roof extensions are the most straightforward, but depend on having a suitable roof.
A dormer loft conversion is a loft extension to your roof, but doesn't normally take up the whole of the roof space. It also has the advantage of adding plenty of natural light.
Mansard extensions are particularly popular within the areas of Central, North and West London that we cover, as they follow local conservation requirements in order to blend in with other properties. Unlike a dormer conversion, it doesn't add to the roof space, but rebuilds the whole side of the roof.
Whichever you choose, the good news is that, with the exception of Mansard loft conversions, planning permission is almost never required (although we will always advise on this).
